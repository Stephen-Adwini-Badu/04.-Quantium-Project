# Quantium Project

## Overview
This project investigates customer spending patterns and sales trends for Quantium. It focuses on understanding price differences across product segments and identifying high-spending customers through advanced analytical methods.

## Objectives
### Objective 1: T-Test Analysis
- **Hypotheses**:
  - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant difference in the unit prices of rides between the Mainstream and (Premium + Budget) groups.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a significant difference in the unit prices of rides between the Mainstream and (Premium + Budget) groups.
- **Insight Goal**: Understand pricing variations across customer groups to inform marketing and pricing strategies.

### Objective 2: Classification Modeling
- **Goal**: Build multiple classification models to predict high-spending customers.
- **Use Case**: Help Quantium target high-value customers more effectively through personalized campaigns.

## Methodology
### Data Preparation
- Import necessary libraries and packages.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset to ensure consistency and usability for analysis.

### Analysis and Modeling
1. **T-Test Analysis**:
   - Compare unit prices across specified customer groups.
   - Evaluate the statistical significance of observed price differences.

2. **Classification Modeling**:
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify features influencing high spending.
   - Train and evaluate multiple classification models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Visualization
- Create insightful data visualizations to highlight sales trends and customer spending patterns.
- Analyze pre-Christmas sales spikes and their contributing factors.

## Observations
- Sales are predominantly driven by the following customer segments:
  - Budget: Older families.
  - Mainstream: Young singles/couples and retirees.
- Sales trends show a significant increase leading up to Christmas.

## Results
- **T-Test Insights**: Determine the significance of pricing differences among customer groups.
- **Classification Insights**: Identify and predict high-spending customers with high accuracy.
